This repo contains the data necessary to reproduce the CRAM calculations in detail for the 
article "Computing the Time-Averaged Nuclide Inventory \\ Using the Chebyshev Rational Approximation Method".

Two computed examples in the article use transmutation matrices.
The first Accuracy Test in section V.A. is a pure decay problem. The transmutation matrix in this case is 
3793x3793 and is presented in the file decaymatrix.mtx.
